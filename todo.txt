- HIGH PRIO: MAKE IT SO USER CAN VIEW RECIPE WHEN THEY SELECT IT

- Add buttons to let user add ingredients and recipes *from the pre-populated databases* (NEEDS TESTING)
- Need to test querying with backend populated data
- Need to test adding recipes and ingredients to the owned recipes
  and saved ingredients tables with backend populated data
- Need to test manually adding ingredients and recipes with backend interactions

(- super low prio: move table with all website ingredients to explore tab, probably extra unnecessary work)
