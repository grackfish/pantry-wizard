- HIGH PRIO: MAKE IT SO USER CAN VIEW RECIPE WHEN THEY SELECT IT

- Add buttons to let user add or delete owned ingredients and saved recipes
- Need to test querying with backend populated data
- Need to test adding recipes and ingredients to the owned recipes
  and saved ingredients tables with backend populated data

(- low prio: we do not need separate tables for preparable recipes vsall saved recipes,
   we can just set default sorting to show preparable recipes at the top of the table)
   
(- super low prio: move table with all website ingredients to explore tab)
